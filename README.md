# JustANobody2107's Scoop Bucket
The official [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) bucket for JustANobody2107's scripts. These will never be added to the main bucket so this is where they'll go.

## Usage

```powershell
scoop bucket add nobody https://github.com/justanobody2107/scoop-bucket.git
# For nekofetch users, run
scoop install nobody/nekofetch
# For uptime users, run
scoop install nobody/uptime
```
